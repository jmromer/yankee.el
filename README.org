* yankee.el

Yankee provides functions for yanking source blocks in Emacs with some helpful
annotations to help readers gain more context:

- ~yankee/yank-as-gfm-code-block~
- ~yankee/yank-as-gfm-code-block-folded~
- ~yankee/yank-as-org-code-block~

Each yanks the selected code block and formats it appropriately: As
GitHub-flavored Markdown, Foldable GFM, or an Org mode source block.

If the file is in a project, its path relative to the project root will be used
to annotate the code block with a comment including the selected line numbers.
(If not in a project, an abbreviated absolute path will be included instead.)

Additionally, if the buffer being yanked from is backed by a file under source
control, a commit ref will be included.

And lastly, if a VCS remote named ~origin~ is found, a hyperlink to the
selection, at the correct commit ref, will be included as well.

** Org mode

(Intentionally broken here so the raw syntax will render)

(defun yankee/current-commit-ref ()
  "The current commit's SHA, if under version control.
